# Advent of Code

For a given year, each day is comprised of up to 2 python files, they are **independent** of each other. In part2 we will copy code from part1 and change what is necessary to solve the puzzle.

You may find my input files in each year's `resources` directory.

## How to solve a specific puzzle?

Follow the commands below:

```python
# move to the desired year
cd 2022
# run the python file related to the desired day and part
python3 24p1.py -i resources/24/input.txt
```
